# Nano's Dotfiles

Welcome to my world! You'll find a collection of config files for various tools and programs that I use on a daily basis. I've carefully curated and customized these tools to streamline my workflow and improve my productivity. Avoid copying these wholesale. Instead, consider what type of functionality you need to help improve your own workflow.
